        "answer": "eZhishi allows only one active session per account at a time for security and data integrity. If you see a message like \"your account is being logged-in elsewhere and has been logged out\", it means the system detected a login for your account from another browser or device, causing your current session to end. \nWhat to do: Ensure that you are only logged in on one device at a time. If you want to switch devices, properly log out from the first device before logging in on the second. If you encounter this message, close any other sessions (you might just wait a minute and then log in again, which will override any other session). If you did not initiate another login and suspect someone else is using your account, immediately reset your password to secure your account. It's also a good practice not to share your password and to keep it confidential. Once you log back in (with a new password if you changed it), the other person will be logged out. This one-login-at-a-time policy is to prevent concurrent use that could confuse the tracking of progress and to protect your account. So always log out after finishing your session, especially on shared or public computers, to avoid unintended concurrent logins."

At the end of the year, existing accounts may expire, and new accounts for the upcoming year will be issued by your school. If your school renews its collective subscription, updated login credentials will be provided once available. In some cases, previous year accounts may be temporarily extended through January or February, but certain features, such as eZhishi Rewards, will be unavailable during this period.\n•\tNo Active Subscription: If neither your school nor you personally have an active subscription, your account will remain inactive. For example, if a previous individual (home) subscription has expired, renewal is required to regain access. You may visit the eZhishi website's subscription page to renew or purchase a new individual subscription.\n\nIf you need further assistance, please take note of the course name, chapter, and any error messages, then contact our customer service via WhatsApp at +65 9012 6012 or email us at service@ecombay.com."

        "answer": "Teachers can use eZhishi's eAssignment feature to create and distribute online homework to students quickly. Here's how it works for teachers:\n•\tAccess the eAssignment tool: After logging in to eZhishi with a teacher account, navigate to the eAssignment or homework section. There will be an option to \"create/publish assignment\" (电子作业发布).\n•\tSelect content from question bank: The teacher can choose questions from eZhishi's question bank. Teacher may select the exercise type (e.g., multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, open-ended) and the number of questions, either letting the system auto-generate a set of questions or select specific questions.. \n•\tSet assignment details: Give the eAssignment a title and instructions. Teachercan assign it to a specific class, multiple classes, a whole grade level, or even individual students as needed. Teacher may also set a start date and due date/time for the assignment.\n•\tPublish the assignment: Once the content and settings are ready, publish the eAssignment. Students in the selected group will receive it automatically when they log in. eZhishi also allows generating a direct assignment link – meaning you can copy a unique URL for the assignment and share it via other platforms (like SLS or Google Classroom). With that link, students can directly access the assignment without a separate login (useful for integration with other systems).\n•\tAutomatic grading and recording: For most question types, eZhishi will auto-mark the submitted answers. This saves grading time as multiple-choice and similar questions are instantly scored. \n•\tReviewing results: After students submit their work, teachers can go to the eAssignment management page to monitor who has completed the assignment and view their scores. The system provides statistics and charts for each assignment, making it easy to see class performance at a glance. Teachers can use this data to identify common mistakes, or which students might need extra help."

        "questionZh": "eZhishi 上的 \"口试互动练习 (eOral)\" 是如何运作的？",
        "answer": "eOral Interactive Practice is a feature designed to help students improve their Chinese oral skills, such as reading aloud and speaking. \n•\tUsing the microphone: eOral requires access to your device's microphone. The first time you use it, your browser (or the eZhishi app) will ask for permission to use the microphone. Make sure to allow this, otherwise the recording won't work. If you accidentally blocked it, you'll need to adjust your browser settings to enable microphone access for the site.\n•\tRecording answers: In an eOral task, you'll typically click a \"Record\" button to start recording your voice. You'll speak your response or read the passage. Once done, you stop the recording and can usually replay it to listen to yourself. Satisfied with your attempt, you then submit the recording through the platform.\n•\tAI Read Aloud evaluation: eZhishi incorporates an AI Read Aloud Evaluation function for oral practice. This AI will analyze your recorded reading pronunciation and fluency. It can provide instant feedback or scores on how accurately you pronounced words and where you might improve. This is like having a virtual coach that helps you refine your speaking.\n•\tTeacher review: If the eOral practice is part of an assignment or a teacher-assigned oral exercise, your teacher can listen to your submitted recordings. The AI evaluation might highlight certain issues, but your teacher may also give personalized feedback or score your oral performance. For example, a teacher might comment on clarity of speech or intonation via the feedback system.\n•\tIndependent practice: There might be an eOral section where students can practice on their own (outside of assignments). If so, you can choose practice passages to read and use the AI to self-check your pronunciation. This can be very helpful for improving oral reading – the more you practice speaking aloud, the more confident and fluent you become."

        "questionZh": "什么是 \"网上练习 (eExercise)\"？学生如何使用这一功能进行练习？",
        "answer": "eExercise is eZhishi's self-practice module – an online exercise system that allows students to practice Chinese questions independently, without it being a teacher-assigned homework. Key features of eExercise:\n•\tQuestion bank practice: eExercise draws from the same extensive question bank. Students can select practice exercises by textbook unit or topic, aligning with what they are learning in school. \n•\tUnlimited attempts: You can practice unlimited times – there is no limit to how many exercises you can do, and you can redo them as needed. This is great for reinforcing knowledge; doing more questions helps consolidate learning.\n•\tNo time pressure: eExercises are typically untimed, and you can do them at your own pace. This makes it ideal for revision or extra practice, as you can focus on understanding rather than racing a clock.\n•\tAutomated generation: The system can automatically generate a set of practice questions for you. When you choose a unit and exercise type, it will pull random questions from that unit's question pool. This means each practice session can be different, giving you fresh questions if available.\n•\tSelf-evaluation: After completing a set of eExercise questions, you can submit for auto-marking (just like assignments). You will see immediate feedback on which answers are correct and your score for that practice set. \n•\tFocus on weak areas: You have the flexibility to target your weaker areas. \n•\tAccessible anytime: eExercise is available to students at any time – you don't have to wait for a teacher to assign homework. You can use it for extra practice after school, during school holidays, or whenever you want to study. \n•\tTeachers and parents monitoring: While eExercise is student-initiated, the records of your practice are still tracked. Teachers (and parents, if they check) can see the practice logs and performance details."

        "answer": "Most of the question types in eAssignments are automatically graded by eZhishi's system, which is one of the platform's advantages. Specifically:\n•\tAuto-marking for objective questions: Questions like multiple-choice (选择题), true/false, matching, fill-in-the-blank (with exact answer), etc., are auto-marked instantly upon submission. Students get immediate feedback on these, and teachers see the scores without needing to grade manually.\n•\t\n•\tOpen-ended questions: For questions that are short-answer or essay type, those cannot be auto-graded by the system for accuracy of content. If an eAssignment includes open-ended responses (like sentence writing or essay), the system will record the student's answer\n•\tAI-assisted grading: Notably, eZhishi has some AI features. For instance, AI Essay Evaluation can help check compositions for errors, which might assist teachers in grading written answers. Similarly, AI Oral Read Aloud can evaluate pronunciation for oral submissions. These AI tools provide feedback and preliminary scoring, but teachers still have the final say in scoring open responses."

        "questionZh": "学生可以对同一个作业尝试多次吗？",
        "answer": "Yes, eZhishi allows students to re-attempt an eAssignment even after the first submission, mainly for practice purposes. However, keep in mind:\n•\tFirst attempt is recorded: Your first submitted attempt is considered the official attempt for grading. The teacher's record will capture that first score as your assignment result.\n•\tMultiple practice attempts: After submitting once, you can often go back to the assignment and try it again. You might do this to improve your understanding or get a better score for yourself. The system will still show you your result each time.\n•\tWithin availability period: You can only reattempt while the assignment is still open. If the teacher set a closing date or once the teacher archives the assignment, you may not be able to submit new attempts."

        "questionZh": "学生如何查看并完成提交电子作业？",
        "answer": "For students, doing an eAssignment on eZhishi is straightforward:\n•\tNotification of assignment: When you log in to eZhishi, you will automatically receive a notification if a teacher has published an eAssignment for you. This could be a pop-up alert or a highlighted icon. Additionally, on your student homepage, there is a \"My Homework (我的作业)\" section or icon – click that to view all assignments.\n•\tAccessthe assignment: In the My Homework section, go to the eAssignment tab or list. You will see the titles of the assignments assigned to you. Click on the assignment title you wish to attempt. This will open the eAssignment exercise page, where you can see the questions.\n•\tAnswer the questions: Complete the assignment by selecting or inputting answers for each question. \n•\tSave progress (if needed): If you cannot finish in one sitting or need to pause, you can click the \"Save\" button to save your progress without submitting. The assignment will be marked as \"uncompleted\" in your homework list. Later, you can return to My Homework and find the assignment under an \"Incomplete Assignments 未完成作业\" list, then continue from where you left off. This is useful if you get interrupted or want to first draft some answers.\n•\tSubmit the assignment: Once you have answered all questions and are ready, click the \"Submit (交卷)\" button. The system will ask for confirmation. After confirming, the system will auto-mark the assignment immediately – for automatically gradable parts, you will instantly see your score and which answers were correct or incorrect. Your assignment results are also automatically recorded and sent to your teacher upon submission.\n•\tView results and feedback: After submitting, you can view a summary of your results (score for each section, total score, etc.). If you submit more than once, note that the first submission's score is what counts for your teacher's record."
